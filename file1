A Jenkins introduction presentation typically covers the following key points:
1. What is Jenkins? 
Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in Java.
It is primarily used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) in software development.
2. Why Jenkins? (Benefits of Continuous Integration)
Early Bug Detection:
Integrates code changes frequently, allowing for quick identification and resolution of integration issues.
Improved Code Quality:
Automated testing and feedback loops help maintain higher code quality.
Faster Release Cycles:
Automates build, test, and deployment processes, enabling more frequent and reliable software releases.
Reduced Manual Effort:
Automates repetitive tasks, freeing up developers to focus on core development.
3. Key Features of Jenkins:
Open Source: Free to use and boasts a large, active community.
Extensible: Highly extensible through a vast ecosystem of plugins (over 1000 available) for various integrations (e.g., SCM, build tools, testing frameworks, notification systems).
Easy to Install and Configure: Straightforward installation process and user-friendly interface.
Distributed Builds: Supports distributed builds across multiple nodes for scalability and efficiency.
Pipeline as Code: Allows defining build pipelines in code (e.g., Jenkinsfile) for version control and reusability.
